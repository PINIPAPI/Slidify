## Slide 1

# Develoment products final project
The aim of doing this project was to learn how to use this tools, instead to create a great
application. 
I use the data from the national statistical department of my country and just show the results.

## Slide 2

We see that this is an intercross with +r nind(sug)+ individuals.
There are +r nphe(sug)+ phenotypes, and genotype data at
+r totmar(sug)+ markers across the +r nchr(sug)+ autosomes.  The genotype
data is quite complete.

Use +plot()+ to get a summary plot of the data.

//begin.rcode summary_plot, fig.height=8
plot(sug)
//end.rcode

#### I must have left sufficent theme to write another three slides
